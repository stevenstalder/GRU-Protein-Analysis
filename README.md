## About the Project

A fundamental task in understanding evolution and fighting diseases is to gain knowledge about proteins and their
assembly. Proteins are chains of amino acids formed into a specific structure [Yanofsky et al., 1964]. Due to recent
research in deep learning and particularly the Natural Language Processing (NLP) area, certain entities of these structures
– e.g. where a chain meets again or how it is twisted – can be predicted more accurately. To achieve more
comparable results, Rao et al. [2019] produced five standardized datasets and specific tasks in the area of protein
prediction. The one tasks we want to take on is the Secondary Structure (SS) prediction.
